# Shopping page using React and Pexels API

This is a simple shopping application built using React. For getting the images I have used Pexels API.

## Features:

- Add an item to the cart (also check if the item is already added)
- Remove an item from the cart
- Compute Total price

## Libraries used

- Axios
- reactstrap
- react-toastify
- react-icons
- faker
- bootstrap

To install the above libraries run the following command

```
npm i axios react-icons react-toastify faker bootstrap
```

## Important

This project works on Pexels API, which has a key for each user. Pexels deserve the right to provide or revoke an API key. Insert your API at `INSERT_API_KEY_HERE` in `BuyProduct.js`
